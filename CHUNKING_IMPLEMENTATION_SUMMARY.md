# Chunking Implementation Summary

## âœ… All Tasks Completed

### 1. Environment Setup
- Created `.env` file with API key
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude environment files
- Created `EnvironmentLoader` helper to load API keys
- API key auto-loads from environment if not set in settings

### 2. Data Model Updates
- Created `AudioChunk` model with index, filepath, duration, and download status
- Updated `AudioItem` with chunking support:
  - `chunks` array with cascade delete
  - `totalChunks` and `downloadedChunks` tracking
  - `isChunked` flag for backward compatibility
  - Computed properties for progress and duration

### 3. Text Chunking Logic
- Intelligent sentence-based splitting
- Respects 4096 character limit with 100 char buffer
- Adds overlap between chunks for context
- Handles edge cases (empty text, exact limit, no punctuation)

### 4. File Storage Updates
- UUID-based directory structure for chunked items
- Chunk files named as `chunk_0.mp3`, `chunk_1.mp3`, etc.
- Support for both legacy single files and chunked storage
- Proper cleanup when deleting items

### 5. Audio Player Updates
- Sequential chunk playback with automatic advancement
- Cross-chunk seeking and skipping
- Progress tracking across all chunks
- Maintains playback position between app launches

### 6. UI Enhancements

#### AddItemView
- Shows character count with chunk indicator
- Progress bar for chunk generation
- "Chunk X of Y" status during processing
- No more character limit - supports any length

#### AudioListView
- Shows chunk download status (e.g., "3/5 chunks")
- Orange color for partially downloaded items
- Total duration across all chunks

#### AudioPlayerView
- Displays current chunk being played
- Seamless progress bar across all chunks
- Skip forward/backward works across chunks

### 7. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of failed chunks
- Continues processing even if individual chunks fail
- Proper cleanup on cancellation
- API error messages displayed to user

### 8. Testing Suite

#### Unit Tests
- `OpenAIServiceTests`: Text chunking logic, API integration
- `FileStorageServiceTests`: File operations, storage calculation
- `AudioPlayerServiceTests`: Playback logic, state management

#### Integration Tests
- `ChunkingIntegrationTests`: Full flow from text to playback
- Progress tracking verification
- Multi-chunk generation and storage

### 9. Performance Optimizations
- Sequential chunk processing to avoid rate limits
- Lazy loading of audio chunks
- Efficient file size calculation
- Memory-conscious chunk handling

## How It Works

1. **Text Analysis**: When user enters text, the system immediately shows how many chunks will be created
2. **Chunk Generation**: Each chunk is processed sequentially with progress updates
3. **Storage**: Chunks are stored in item-specific directories for easy management
4. **Playback**: Player automatically advances through chunks with seamless transitions
5. **Seeking**: Users can skip or seek to any position across all chunks

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the app with the provided API key in `.env`
2. Try these test cases:
   - Short text (<4096 chars) - Single chunk
   - Medium text (~8000 chars) - 2-3 chunks  
   - Long text (>20000 chars) - Multiple chunks
   - Skip during playback - Verify cross-chunk navigation
   - Close and reopen app - Verify position persistence

## Technical Highlights

- **Smart Chunking**: Preserves sentence boundaries and adds context overlap
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates during chunk generation
- **Seamless Playback**: Automatic chunk advancement with no gaps
- **Backward Compatible**: Still supports legacy single-file items
- **Robust Storage**: UUID-based paths prevent conflicts
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Unit and integration tests with real API calls

The implementation successfully removes the 4096 character limit while providing excellent user experience through progress tracking and seamless playback.
