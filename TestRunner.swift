        Once upon a time in a digital realm, there lived an AI assistant named Claude who helped developers build amazing applications. Claude was particularly skilled at breaking down complex problems into manageable chunks, making it easier for developers to implement sophisticated features.
        
        One day, a developer came to Claude with a challenge: they needed to convert very long texts into speech, but the API they were using had a character limit. Claude suggested implementing a chunking system that would intelligently split the text while maintaining context between chunks.
        
        The developer was impressed with this solution and asked Claude to help design the entire system. Together, they created a robust architecture that could handle texts of any length, providing visual feedback to users about the chunking process and ensuring smooth playback across multiple audio files.

üì± How to Test the Full Implementation:

1. Open the YATTS app in Xcode
2. Build and run on simulator or device
3. Go to Settings and enter the API key (or it will load from .env)
4. Create a new audio item with various text lengths
5. Observe:
   - Character count showing number of chunks
   - Progress bar during chunk generation
   - Chunk status in the audio list
   - Chunk indicator during playback
   - Seamless playback across chunks
   - Seeking and skipping across chunk boundaries

üîë The API key is loaded from the .env file automatically.

‚ö° Performance Tips:
- Chunks are processed sequentially to avoid rate limits
- Each chunk includes overlap for better context
- Failed chunks can be retried individually
- Storage is optimized with UUID-based directories
